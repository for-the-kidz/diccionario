# diccionario

A simple word list service control plane.

It has the following capabilities:

* Check if a word exists in the word list
* Add a new word to the word list
* Find a list of words that match a given prefix

The word list is stored in a flat file at [words.txt](./words.txt).

# Endpoints

## /exists/:word

This endpoint checks if a word exists in the word list.
This endpoint has some issues with it's implementation.

Requirements:
* It returns a 200 upon success
* It returns other status codes as appropriate (4XXs for input errors, 5XXs for internal server errors)
* The response body is a JSON object with a single field `exists` of type boolean
  * Example: `{ "exists": true }`
* It performs case insensitive matching to the words in the wordlist
* It only returns true if the word exists (exactly matches)in the wordlist

## /add (add a word)

This endpoint adds a new word to the word list.
This endpoint needs to be implemented still.

Requirements:
* It returns a 204 upon success.
* It returns a 409 if the word already exists in the word list.
* It returns other status codes as appropriate (4XXs for input errors, 5XXs for internal server errors)
* The newly added word should persist for the life of the running Docker container.
* A word is considered a single string of unbroken alpha characters (no numbers or special characters)

## /matches/:prefix

This endpoint returns a list of words that match a given prefix.
This endpoint needs to be more performant.

Requirements:
* It returns a 200 upon success
* It returns other status codes as appropriate (4XXs for input errors, 5XXs for internal server errors)
* The response body is a JSON object with a single field `matches` of type string array
  * Example: `{ "matches": ["word1", "word2"] }`
* It performs case insensitive matching to the words in the wordlist
* It only returns words that match the given prefix
